# Tensorflow-Rock-Paper-Sicissor-image-classification

Performing Multi class classification by building Convolutional neural network. The data used is GANs generated images of hands with different colour, shapes textures etc.

In this experiment I will build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using Tensorflow to recognize Rock-Paper-Scissors signs (gestures) on the photo.

A convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.
